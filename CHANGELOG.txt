** 1.4 (2011-07-14)
	- Complete rewrite of MetaClassify (now named 'weka-run') using the latest version of Weka (3.7.4). Compatible schemes are now looked for thanks to a call to weka.core.FindWithCapabilities; a stand-alone utility, 'weka-list' can be used to list those compatible schemes
	- Addition of a stand-alone parser ('weka-parse') to extract scores from raw Weka output. Export capabilities to JSON and CSV formats
	- Addition of table2ARFF (now named 'weka-convert'), a tab-delimited to ARFF format converter for training sets with filtering abilities

** 1.3 (2006-12-21)
	- MetaClassify now use the weka.core.Capabilities framework introduced in version 3.5.3. For any given dataset, a more exhaustive search of compatible classifiers is done, at the price of reduced backward compatibility. As a result, MetaClassify only works with Weka v3.5.3 or more recent
	- Behind-the-scene refactoring ensuring a better control of the users-defined options
	- Lot of options had their name changed to be more intuitive; please read the below documentation

** 1.2c (2006-04-03)
	- Better handling (and display) of the errors
	- Added: ability to extract scores on training set

** 1.2b (2006-02-09)
	- Added: test set handling
	- Added: options to exclude the use of some given classifiers
	- Bug related to classifiers' options corrected
  
** 1.2 (2006-01-20)
	- Better parsing of the Weka output (works with Weka v3.5.1)
	- Added: more scores are extracted (confusion matrix, ROC area)
	- Added: ability to extract scores from previously saved HTML-formated outputs
	- Added: ability to use a meta-classifier
	- Added: ability to use previously saved models
  
** 0.1 (2005-12-09)
	First version. Works with Weka v3.4.5
